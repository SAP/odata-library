# Actions

Actions are similar like function imports, but actions are primarily
used for CRUD operations (which could have side effect) and function
imports are normally used to just get informations without side effects.

We have implemented bound Actions.
Actions raises POST method.

# Call bound Actions

The instance of Action is function bound to a resource.

If the resource has entity type, to make action call function named by
action on entity instance.

```javascript
let service = new Service("https://host/path/to/service/0001/");

service.init.then(() => {
	return service.InHouseRepair.key({
		InHouseRepair:"1000000045"
	}).ConfirmRepairObjects({
		parameter1: "value"
	});
})
.then(console.log)
.catch(console.log);
```

If the resource has entity type collection, the action can be invoked
directly on the entity set.

```javascript
await service.InHouseRepair.createRepairObject({
	parameter1: "value"
});
```

# Call unbound Actions

Unbound actions are invoked through Action Imports and can be called same way as function imports.

```javascript
await service.RepairObject({
	parameter1: "value"
});
```
